# vuewordgame
A simple word game, built with Vue JS (2.0). Inspired by Hangman, it gives you a random (but common English) word, and asks you to guess it, letter by letter.

Live demo: http://wordgame.softwarecradle.com/

## Purpose
This is meant to serve as an educational example, as it demonstrates some very commonly used features of Vue JS

- State
- Computed Properties
- Method
- Event Handling

This also shows how to build cool widgets such as a circular progress indicator (which, at the time of writing this, is coded into App.vue, but I intend to make it a standalone component some day).

Lastly, it is fun to play (as long as you don't cheat by peeking at the Vue Devtools)!
